# Object-Oriented-Programming

<h3>OOPS Guidebook -- UNDER CONSTRUCTION<br></h3>
This is my guidebook to Object Oriented Programming in C++

<h3>What is Object Oriented Programming?<br></h3>
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.<br>

<h3>Why C++<br></h3>
C++ is a highly portable language and is often the language of choice for multi-device, multi-platform app development.<br>
C++ is an object-oriented programming language and includes classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction and encapsulation.<br>
C++ has a rich function library.<br>
C++ allows exception handling, and function overloading which are not possible in C.<br>
C++ is a powerful, efficient and fast language. It finds a wide range of applications â€“ from GUI applications to 3D graphics for games to real-time mathematical simulations.<br>
